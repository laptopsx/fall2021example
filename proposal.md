# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Dots and boxes 2.0

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This will be a game where two players will take turns on a empty grid of dots where they add a vertical or horizonal line to make a square or box. A player who completes the fourth side of the square/box will take the point and one of the players will win by having the most points. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will use Turtle as a resource to take turns on the game and use functions. I will also will use the goto method in order for the players to draw a horizontal or vertical line smoothly.  The game will be executed through Python and will use for loops, todo, functions, and turtles. It will use the draw function as well in order for the lines to draw. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I don't think I am, but if I do intend to do that then I might use my other project where we will be using API, javascript, nodejs, and SQL to make a toll calculator project where drivers can check the toll between any two interchanges on Pennsylvania turnpike. I feel like the coding aspect could relate to the course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the ability to making a dotted grid 
I will accomplish the ability to make a player input to draw a line and make a box.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish the ability into making a grid and making one of the players the ability to draw a line horizontally or vertically.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I really hope to accomplish at least the ability for an interactive game where at least one of the players can score and win the game by making a box of squares. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills that I need to be able to acquire in order for this to work would have to be pygame, learning how to build programs, defing classes and more. I picked the pygame to learn and research because I need to understand how can I make the ability to make a game and pygame is a great resource for that. I also want to learn how to directly build a program because I have been executing my skills bit by bit but I still don't know how to make a program yet. Lastly, defining classes seems like an important tool that I could use for my game that I'm going to make.
