Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I started putting my dots on the game(the background is supposed to be filled with dots)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I haven't really done the two player version yet, but I would like to get started as soon as possible. I might have to turn it in a little later if the process gets difficult. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Nothing so far, but I will update this when I make a lot of progress in my game.
